```{r}

[1] 9.333333 1.333333 4.000000 6.333333 0.000000 7.333333 4.000000


```
The 0 means the model was solved
25,250 is the minimized amount total to satisfy the schedule
Variables shown are the amounts of each type of worker necessary

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
